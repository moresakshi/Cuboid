# 🧱 Cuboid

## 📘 Project Description
Cuboid is a Solidity-based smart contract project that allows users to create and manage a digital 3D cuboid object on the blockchain. The contract supports setting dimensions, calculating volume, and updating measurements securely.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To demonstrate how real-world geometric data can be securely managed, verified, and interacted with on the blockchain using smart contracts. Cuboid aims to serve as a base model for 3D asset tracking, virtual space management, and digital twin applications.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Create Cuboid:** Initialize a cuboid with custom dimensions.
- **Compute Volume:** Instantly calculate the 3D volume of the cuboid.
- **Update Dimensions:** The owner can modify the cuboid’s size.
- **Ownership Logic:** Only the creator (owner) can make modifications.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add **surface area** and **diagonal length** calculations.
- Integrate with **3D visualization tools** for virtual asset rendering.
- Allow multiple cuboid instances per user.
- Introduce **NFT representation** of cuboids for trading in metaverse projects.
